# 🌍 V200 Per-Zone Earthquake Probability Forecasts

**Daily probabilistic earthquake forecasts with zone-specific calibration for 563 seismically active zones worldwide.**

---

## Overview

This repository contains daily earthquake probability forecasts generated by the **V200 Per-Zone model**. Unlike the V200 Global model which uses uniform thresholds across all zones, the Per-Zone model calibrates alert thresholds individually for each geographic zone, accounting for regional seismicity patterns.

Each day, the model produces probability estimates for seismic events across four magnitude tiers, covering the next 2-3 days.

The forecasts are designed to support:
- Emergency preparedness planning
- Insurance risk assessment
- Infrastructure monitoring decisions
- Research into seismic patterns

---

## Key Difference: Per-Zone vs Global Model

| Aspect | V200 Global | V200 Per-Zone (this repo) |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Threshold Calibration** | Single threshold per tier | Zone-specific thresholds |
| **Alert Tuning** | Same sensitivity everywhere | Tuned to local seismicity |
| **Prediction Output** | Probabilities + alerts | Probabilities + alerts + thresholds used |
| **Zone Boundaries** | Zone ID only | Full lat/lon boundaries included |

**Why Per-Zone Calibration Matters:**
- A zone with frequent M2.5 events (e.g., Southern California) needs different thresholds than a quieter region
- Per-zone calibration maintains consistent alert rates across diverse seismic environments
- Reduces false alarms in high-activity zones while maintaining sensitivity in quieter zones

## Forecast Tiers

| Tier | Name | Magnitude | Forecast Window | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **T1** | Micro | M ≥ 2.5 | 2 days | Microseismic activity (generally not felt) |
| **T2** | Felt | M ≥ 4.5 | 2 days | Earthquakes typically felt by people |
| **T3** | Minor | M ≥ 5.5 | 3 days | Potential for minor structural damage |
| **T4** | Damage | M ≥ 6.0 | 3 days | Significant earthquake with damage potential |

---

## Zone Coverage

The model covers **563 seismically active zones** worldwide, defined on a 5° × 5° global grid. Zones are identified by their southwest corner coordinates (e.g., `Z_35_-120` covers 35°N to 40°N, 120°W to 115°W).

**New in Per-Zone Model:** Each prediction includes full zone boundary coordinates:
```json
{
  "zone_id": "Z_35_-120",
  "zone_boundaries": {
    "lat_min": 35.0,
    "lat_max": 40.0,
    "lon_min": -120.0,
    "lon_max": -115.0,
    "center_lat": 37.5,
    "center_lon": -117.5
  }
}
```

Coverage includes major seismic regions:
- Pacific Ring of Fire
- Mediterranean-Himalayan Belt
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge
- East African Rift
- And other seismically active areas

---

## Calibration Files

The `/calibration` folder contains static model configuration files committed once at deployment. These files define how predictions are generated and how alert thresholds are set.

### `v200_perzone_calibrated_thresholds.json`

Contains both **global fallback thresholds** and **zone-specific thresholds** for each tier:

```json

**Key Fields:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model_version` | Identifier for the deployed model version |
| `calibration_period` | Historical period used to calibrate thresholds |
| `thresholds` | **Global fallback thresholds** — used when a zone lacks sufficient data for calibration |
| `zone_thresholds` | **Per-zone thresholds** — zone-specific calibration when sufficient historical data exists |
| `zone_calibration_stats` | How many zones have per-zone vs fallback thresholds |

### Calibration Requirements

A zone receives per-zone thresholds only if it meets minimum data requirements for statistical reliability. Zones not meeting these requirements use global fallback thresholds.

### `v200_perzone_active_zones.json`

Lists all 563 zones for which the model generates daily predictions:

```json
{
  "n_zones": 563,
  "zones": ["Z_-60_-75", "Z_-55_-70", "Z_35_-120", ...]
}
```

### `v200_perzone_model_metadata.json`

General model information including version identifier, training completion date, and high-level configuration summary.

## Performance Dashboard

### Important: Dashboard Scope

> ⚠️ **The dashboard reports performance metrics for a subset of zones only.**
>
> **Predictions are generated daily for all 563 active zones worldwide.** However, the performance dashboard focuses on a curated list of approximately **150-200 "Viable Zones"** — commercially significant locations prioritized for insurance and infrastructure applications.
>
> This subset was selected based on population exposure, infrastructure density, and historical seismic significance. If you need performance metrics for zones outside the viable list, contact us for custom analysis.

### Dashboard Files

The `/dashboards` folder contains two types of performance reports, updated daily after each verification cycle:

#### 1. Aggregated Performance (`aggregated/YYYY-MM-DD_viable_performance.json`)

## Understanding the Metrics

### Confusion Matrix Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hit (True Positive)** | Alert was issued AND an earthquake occurred in the window |
| **Miss (False Negative)** | No alert was issued BUT an earthquake occurred |
| **False Alarm (False Positive)** | Alert was issued BUT no earthquake occurred |
| **True Negative** | No alert was issued AND no earthquake occurred |

### Performance Metrics Explained

| Metric | Formula | What It Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Precision** | Hits ÷ (Hits + False Alarms) | "When we alert, how often are we right?" Higher precision means fewer false alarms per alert issued. |
| **Recall** | Hits ÷ (Hits + Misses) | "Of all earthquakes that occurred, what fraction did we alert for?" Higher recall means we catch more events. |
| **F1 Score** | 2 × (Precision × Recall) ÷ (Precision + Recall) | Harmonic mean of precision and recall — balances both concerns. |
| **False Alarm Rate (FAR)** | False Alarms ÷ (False Alarms + True Negatives) | "What fraction of quiet days triggered alerts?" Lower is better. |
| **Lift** | Precision ÷ Base Rate | "How many times better than random guessing?" A lift of 8× means our alerts are 8 times more likely to precede an earthquake than random chance. |
| **Base Rate** | Total Events ÷ Total Predictions | Natural frequency of earthquakes — what you'd achieve by random guessing. |
| **Alert Rate** | (Hits + False Alarms) ÷ Total Predictions | Fraction of zone-days that triggered alerts at this budget level. |

### Interpreting the Metrics

| Metric | Good Value | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Precision** | > 0.20 for T4 | 1 in 5 alerts results in an event (very good for rare events) |
| **Recall** | > 0.70 | Capturing 70%+ of all damaging earthquakes |
| **Lift** | > 5× | 5× better than random — strong predictive signal |
| **FAR** | < 0.02 | Less than 2% of quiet days trigger false alarms |

### Rolling Windows

Metrics are computed over three time horizons:

| Window | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **7-day** | Recent performance snapshot (more volatile, useful for detecting sudden changes) |
| **30-day** | Medium-term trend (recommended for routine monitoring) |
| **90-day** | Long-term baseline (most stable, best for overall model assessment) |

---

## Understanding Probability and Alerts

### Probability Values

Each zone receives a probability estimate (0.0 to 1.0) for each tier, representing the likelihood of at least one earthquake at or above that magnitude occurring within the forecast window.

### Alert Budgets

Alerts are triggered when a zone's probability exceeds a calibrated threshold. **In the Per-Zone model, these thresholds vary by zone** to maintain consistent alert rates across different seismic environments.

| Budget | Meaning | Typical Use Case |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **0.5%** | Highest threshold, fewest alerts (~4 alerts/day globally) | Critical infrastructure, nuclear facilities |
| **1.0%** | Very selective (~8 alerts/day) | High-consequence decisions |
| **2.0%** | Selective (~17 alerts/day) | Elevated preparedness |
| **5.0%** | Moderate (~42 alerts/day) | General monitoring |
| **10.0%** | Sensitive (~85 alerts/day) | Broad awareness, research |

**The budget percentage indicates approximately what fraction of zone-days will trigger alerts.** At 1% budget, roughly 1% of all daily zone predictions will be flagged.

---

## Verification & Integrity

### Immutable Timestamps

Each prediction file is committed to GitHub **before** the forecast window begins. The Git commit timestamp provides cryptographic proof that predictions were made in advance, enabling independent verification by any third party.

### Data Integrity

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `data_hash` | SHA-256 hash of prediction content for tamper detection |
| Git commit hash | Immutable record of exactly when predictions were published |

Third parties can clone this repository and verify that predictions were committed before the earthquakes they predicted.

---

## Limitations & Disclaimers

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Please read carefully**

1. **Not deterministic prediction**: Earthquakes cannot be predicted with certainty. These are probabilistic forecasts indicating relative likelihood.

2. **Not evacuation guidance**: These forecasts are NOT intended for evacuation decisions or emergency response. Always follow guidance from official agencies (USGS, local emergency management).

3. **No liability**: These forecasts are provided for informational and research purposes. The authors assume no liability for decisions made based on this data.

4. **Baseline risk exists everywhere**: A zone without alerts still has seismic risk. Absence of alert ≠ safety guarantee.

5. **Model limitations**: Like all models, this will produce both false positives (alerts without events) and false negatives (events without alerts).

6. **Dashboard scope**: Performance metrics cover only the ~178 viable zones, not all 563 predicted zones. Contact us for metrics on other zones.

7. **Calibration coverage**: Not all zones have per-zone calibrated thresholds. Zones with insufficient historical data use global fallback thresholds (indicated by `threshold_source: "global_fallback"`).
